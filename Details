Smart Stick for the Blind
Overview
The Smart Stick is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely. Using ultrasonic sensors, the device detects obstacles and provides feedback through vibrations and sound, enabling users to walk confidently.

Features
Obstacle Detection: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance to nearby objects.
Feedback Mechanisms: Incorporates buzzers and LEDs to alert users of obstacles at varying distances.
User-Friendly: Simple setup and operation, making it accessible for individuals with visual impairments.
Hardware Components
Arduino UNO - The main microcontroller for processing data and controlling outputs.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) - Measures the distance to obstacles.
Buzzers - Provide audio feedback to the user (active and passive).
LED - Provides visual feedback through vibrations.

Code Explanation
The following Arduino code controls the smart stick's functionality:

Setup Function
Initializes serial communication and sets pin modes for the ultrasonic sensor, buzzers, and LED.
Loop Function
Continuously measures distance using the ultrasonic sensor.
Provides feedback based on distance:
< 40 cm: LED turns on.
< 20 cm: LED and active buzzer turn on.
< 10 cm: LED, active buzzer, and passive buzzer turn on.
